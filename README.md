# jkbroot/thawani
This Laravel package facilitates easy integration with the Thawani payment gateway, offering a straightforward and intuitive set of functionalities for payment session creation, customer management, and transaction handling, all within your Laravel application.

# Features
* Easy integration with Laravel applications
* Support for creating and managing Thawani checkout sessions
* Customer management utilities
* Payment and refund handling
* Support for payment intents

**Requirements**
* PHP 7.3 or higher
* Laravel 6.0 or higher

## Installation
```bash
composer require jkbroot/thawani
```
This package supports Package Auto-Discovery, which was introduced in Laravel 5.5. Therefore, it doesn't require manual registration of the ServiceProvider in most cases.

If you're using a version of Laravel where auto-discovery is not supported or have specifically disabled it, you need to register the ServiceProvider manually.

Add the ServiceProvider to the providers array in config/app.php:

```php

'providers' => [
    // Other Service Providers

    Jkbroot\Thawani\ThawaniServiceProvider::class,
],

```

**Configuration:** 

Publish the configuration file by running the following Artisan command. This will publish the Thawani configuration file to config/thawani.php, where you can customize your settings.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config
```
_Copy the Thawani Pay configuration snippet you provided and paste it into your .env file. However,The THAWANI_MODE should be set to live instead of test for a production environment :_
```
#Thawani Pay Configuration for Production Environment
THAWANI_LIVE_SECRET_KEY=your_thawani_live_secret_key
THAWANI_LIVE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_thawani_live_publishable_key
#Thawani mode change to (live) for production.
THAWANI_MODE=test
```
Replace your_thawani_live_secret_key and your_thawani_live_publishable_key with your actual Thawani live secret and publishable keys.

## Instantiating ThawaniPay Class

To begin using the Thawani payment functionality, you need to instantiate the `ThawaniPay` class. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Import ThawaniPay Class

Before you can create an instance of the `ThawaniPay` class, ensure that you import it into your PHP file using the `use` statement:

```php
use Jkbroot\Thawani\ThawaniPay;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate ThawaniPay Class
Once the class is imported, you can instantiate it using the following code:
```php
$thawani = new ThawaniPay();
```
This creates an instance of the ThawaniPay class, allowing you to utilize its methods and properties for handling Thawani payments within your Laravel application.

**Additional Notes**
* Ensure that you have installed the jkbroot/thawani package via Composer before attempting to use it.
* Review the package documentation for any specific configurations, requirements, or additional functionality provided by the package.
